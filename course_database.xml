    <title>Introduction to Computer Programming</title>
    <description>Computer programming is a way of thinking. A successful programmer needs to take a word problem, generate a pseudocode algorithm, and convert it to the syntax of a specific programming language. This course is an alternative to CSCI 1100 and is intended for students who want an introduction to this programming process but do not intend to do further course work in programming or computer science. Emphasis will be on the generation of the algorithms. Rather than using the complex syntax of a production language such as C or C++, this course will use Visual Basic. This allows us to concentrate on the fundamentals and not get sidetracked by language complexity. It also affords students a tool for creating useful personal applications or prototypes in the future. (Students cannot get credit for this course if they have already taken any other CSCI course</description>

    <title>Graphical User Interfaces</title>
    <description>Building graphical user interfaces, or GUIs, are the norm in modern computing. Once a user interface concept is designed and tested, it must be implemented by programming teams on specific hardware platforms. How the interface is specified is a real challenge. Likewise, a number of standards and tools exist that establish the &#8220;look and feel&#8221; of the interface. Introduces the history of GUIs; shows how they can be specified; presents the concept of event-driven programming upon which they are based, and discusses their current status, and compares today&#8217;s standards such as Macintosh, Motif, and MS Windows. It also predicts the future based on current computer capabilities and interface trends.

    <title>Professional Project</title>
    <description>Active participation in a semester-long project, under the supervision of a faculty adviser. A Professional Project often serves as a culminating experience for a Professional Master&#8217;s program but, with departmental or school approval, can be used to fulfill other program requirements. With approval, students may register for more than one Professional Project. Professional Projects must result in documentation established by each department or school, but are not submitted to the Graduate School and are not archived in the library. Grades of A, B,C, or F are assigned by the faculty adviser at the end of the semester. If not completed on time, a formal Incomplete grade may be assigned by the faculty adviser, listing the work remaining to be completed and the time limit for completing this work.

    <title>Robotics II</title>
    <description>This course introduces methods that leverage the basic analysis techniques learned in Robotics I to develop numerical and algorithmic techniques needed to endow robots with the &#8220;intelligence&#8221; to devise strategies to solve problems they will encounter. Once these abilities are sufficiently well developed, robots will become safe and autonomous, thus paving the way for pervasive personal robots. Topics include: configuration space representation, cell decomposition, roadmap methods, rapidly-exploring random trees, simultaneous localization and mapping, contact modeling, grasping, and dexterous manipulation.

    <title>Professional Project</title>
    <description>Active participation in a semester-long project, under the supervision of a faculty adviser. A Professional Project often serves as a culminating experience for a Professional Master&#8217;s program but, with departmental or school approval, can be used to fulfill other program requirements. With approval, students may register for more than one Professional Project. Professional Projects must result in documentation established by each department or school, but are not submitted to the Graduate School and are not archived in the library. Grades of A, B, C, or F are assigned by the faculty adviser at the end of the semester. If not completed on time, a formal Incomplete grade may be assigned by the faculty adviser, listing the work remaining to be completed and the time limit for completing this work.

    <title>Professional Project</title>
    <description>Active participation in a semester-long project, under the supervision of a faculty adviser. A Professional Project often serves as a culminating experience for a Professional Master&#8217;s program but, with departmental or school approval, can be used to fulfill other program requirements. With approval, students may register for more than one Professional Project. Professional Projects must result in documentation established by each department or school, but are not submitted to the Graduate School and are not archived in the library. Grades of A, B, C, or F are assigned by the faculty adviser at the end of the semester. If not completed on time, a formal Incomplete grade may be assigned by the faculty adviser, listing the work remaining to be completed and the time limit for completing this work.

    <title>Professional Project</title>
    <description>Active participation in a semester-long project, under the supervision of a faculty adviser. A Professional Project often serves as a culminating experience for a Professional Master&#8217;s program but, with departmental or school approval, can be used to fulfill other program requirements. With approval, students may register for more than one Professional Project. Professional Projects must result in documentation established by each department or school, but are not submitted to the Graduate School and are not archived in the library. Grades of A,B,C, or F are assigned by the faculty adviser at the end of the semester. If not completed on time, a formal Incomplete grade may be assigned by the faculty adviser, listing the work remaining to be completed and the time limit for completing this work.

    <title>Information in History and Society</title>
    <description>What is the relationship between information, information technology, and culture? How do we acquire, organize and share our understandings of the world? How has this been done differently in different time periods and in different cultural contexts? Through an analysis of a broad spectrum of information technologies, from the printing press and early maps, to telephone, television, computers and the internet, the goal of this course is to come to a deeper, more critical understanding of these questions and their answers. This is a communication-intensive course.</description>

    <title>Experiential Learning Project</title>
    <description>This is an individually tailored reading course in which the student does readings and also completes an internship-type field project for the minor in cross-cultural studies of science and technology. The goal is to provide students with immersion in a multicultural milieu involving science and technology issues. Projects include student exchange programs, co-op placement, public service internships, community service, and other individually tailored projects subject to adviser approval. Students are expected to write up a description of their field project that integrates their field experience with the readings.

NOTE: Offered on sufficient demand.
