    <title>Introduction to Computer Programming</title>
    <description>Computer programming is a way of thinking. A successful programmer needs to take a word problem, generate a pseudocode algorithm, and convert it to the syntax of a specific programming language. This course is an alternative to CSCI 1100 and is intended for students who want an introduction to this programming process but do not intend to do further course work in programming or computer science. Emphasis will be on the generation of the algorithms. Rather than using the complex syntax of a production language such as C or C++, this course will use Visual Basic. This allows us to concentrate on the fundamentals and not get sidetracked by language complexity. It also affords students a tool for creating useful personal applications or prototypes in the future. (Students cannot get credit for this course if they have already taken any other CSCI course</description>

    <description>Building graphical user interfaces, or GUIs, are the norm in modern computing. Once a user interface concept is designed and tested, it must be implemented by programming teams on specific hardware platforms. How the interface is specified is a real challenge. Likewise, a number of standards and tools exist that establish the &#8220;look and feel&#8221; of the interface. Introduces the history of GUIs; shows how they can be specified; presents the concept of event-driven programming upon which they are based, and discusses their current status, and compares today&#8217;s standards such as Macintosh, Motif, and MS Windows. It also predicts the future based on current computer capabilities and interface trends.

    <title>Robotics II</title>
    <description>This course introduces methods that leverage the basic analysis techniques learned in Robotics I to develop numerical and algorithmic techniques needed to endow robots with the &#8220;intelligence&#8221; to devise strategies to solve problems they will encounter. Once these abilities are sufficiently well developed, robots will become safe and autonomous, thus paving the way for pervasive personal robots. Topics include: configuration space representation, cell decomposition, roadmap methods, rapidly-exploring random trees, simultaneous localization and mapping, contact modeling, grasping, and dexterous manipulation.

    <title>Psychology and The Law</title>
    <description>Since the 1950&#8217;s, social science researchers have turned their attention to the courtroom, in order to test theories of human behavior in a real world application. Are the basic assumptions underlying the practice of law in this country valid, given what psychologists know about the fundamentals of human behavior? This course will provide students with instruction regarding how the study of psychology can contribute to a better understanding of the legal system.

    <description>This course allows students to develop a critical understanding of the relationships between design, culture, and society. We define &#8216;design&#8217; broadly, touching on product/industrial design, urban design, and so-called alternative design approaches such as ecological and feminist design. We focus on the role of design in contemporary culture with the goal of training students&#8217; emerging appreciation of design as cultural practice on their professional work as engineers, architects, or business managers. This is a communication-intensive course.</description>

    <title>Environment and Society</title>
    <description>The course&#8217;s main theme is ecological sustainability: what it is, how it might be achieved, how it can be maintained. The theory and practice of sustainability is explored in three parts: through an examination of the concepts, actors, and processes of society-environment interactions; through an analysis of environmental philosophies and models for action; and by addressing the problems and prospects for building sustainable societies. This course prepares students for advanced environmental humanities and social sciences courses.

    <title>Inequality in America</title>
    <description>Modern societies are characterized by varying degrees of social inequality or differences in education, income, wealth, status, and power. How large are these differences in the U.S.? What are their consequences? How are they created, and why do they persist? We examine such issues using social statistics, ethnographic accounts of people&#8217;s lives, international comparative data, and theoretical writings on social class.

    <description>&#8220;Sex&#8221; is the biological distinction between being male and female. &#8220;Gender&#8221; is the social construction of masculinity and femininity. The purpose of this course is to explore if, and if so, how, science and technology reciprocally contribute to and are shaped by gender ideals and images. We use gender as a tool for critical thinking about such topics as studies of sex differences, women in science and engineering, the environment, and war and peace.
